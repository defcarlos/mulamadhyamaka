# Word count of Mulamadhyamakakarika
## Introduction
While it is clear and agreed upon that the central topic of Mulamadhyamakakarika (MMK) is emptiness, I was curious to see if a word count of the text would reveal an emphasis by Nagarjuna on specific topics related to this theme. Moreover, I hoped that in finding that he used certain words with some frequency that it would help me to better understand the unifying theme by paying closer attention to parts of the text with frequently occurring words. 

## Methods
I created a text file version of MMK I could read into Python. I sourced the text from the [Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon](https://www.dsbcproject.org/canon-text/book/242).

Using the cltk (classical language toolkit) code library I tokenized the text. 

## Results
There were 2162 tokens, excluding things like chapter numbers and a few punctuations that made it through the filters.The word with the most occurrences in the text is na (न) "no/not" with 236 occurrences. The second word with most occurrences in the text is ca (च) "and" with 162 occurrences. Below are all the Sanskrit words (40) that occurred 10 or more times in the text.
